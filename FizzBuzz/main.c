If yes to both (multiple of both 3 & 5) then print FizzBuzz instead of value. Repeat untill i = 100.

/*Looking back, this program didn't work the first few times. I realised that if wrote it so that the "else if" loop read the first condition as (multiple of 3) or (multiple of 5) alone, it assigns the Fizz or Buzz to i, then moves on. Not having to look at the (multiples of both) condition. Making that top priority assures that it does not get skipped over. [[Excuse my terminology in this explination as my coding knowledge is finite]] :)
